# Defines the Array class, which stores any N-dimensional array-like data.

class Array:
    """
    A class which stores any N-dimensional array-like data, plus basic metadata:
    a name and units, as well as calibrations for each axis of the array, and names
    and units for those axis calibrations.

    In the simplest usage, only a data array is passed:

    >>> ar = Array(np.ones((20,20,256,256)))

    will create an array instance whose data is the numpy array passed, and with
    automatically populated dimension calibrations in units of pixels.

    Additional arguments may be passed to populate the object metadata:

    >>> ar = Array(
    >>>     np.ones((20,20,256,256)
    >>>     name = 'test_array',
    >>>     units = 'intensity',
    >>>     dims = [
    >>>         [0,5],
    >>>         [0,5],
    >>>         [0,0.01],
    >>>         [0,0.01]
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_units = [
    >>>         'nm',
    >>>         'nm',
    >>>         'A^-1',
    >>>         'A^-1'
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_names = [
    >>>         'rx',
    >>>         'ry',
    >>>         'qx',
    >>>         'qy'
    >>>     ],
    >>> )

    will create an array with a name and units for its data, with its first two
    dimensions in units of nanometers, with each pixel having a size of 5nm, and
    described by the handles 'rx' and 'ry', here meant to represent the (x,y)
    position in real space, and with its last two dimensions in units of inverse
    Angstroms, with each pixel having a size of 0.01A^-1, and dsecribed by the
    handles 'qx' and 'qy', representing the (x,y) position in diffraction space.

    Arrays in which the length of each pixel is non-constant are also
    supported.  For instance,

    >>> x = np.logspace(0,1,100)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> ar = Array(
    >>>     y,
    >>>     dims = [
    >>>         x
    >>>     ]
    >>> )

    generates an array representing the values of the sine function sampled
    along a logarithmic interval from 1 to 10. In this example, this data
    could then be plotted with, e.g.

    >>> plt.scatter(ar.dims[0], ar.data)

            dims (list): calibration vectors for each of the axes of the data
                array.  If this isn't passed, dims will be automatically
                populated with integer values representing the pixel numbers.
                If dims is a list with length < the array dimensions, the passed
                values are assumed to apply to the first N dimensions, and the
                remaining dimensions are populated automatically as above. Each
                passed dim vector must have either a length of 2, or a length
                equal to the extent of the corresponding dimension of the data
                array. If it has a length of 2, the entire calibration vector
                will be extrapolated linearly from these initial two values.
            dim_units (list): the units for the calibration dim vectors. If
                nothing is passed, dims vectors which have been populated
                automatically with integers corresponding to pixel numbers

                which are not passed, following the same logic as described
