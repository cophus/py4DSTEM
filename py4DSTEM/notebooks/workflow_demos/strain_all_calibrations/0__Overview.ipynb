    "# Strain mapping with all calibrations\n",

    "The notebooks in this directory enable mapping strain in a material from 4D-STEM data with a full suite of calibrations.  The calibrations here include\n",
    "\n",
    "- rotational offsets: determining and accounting for rotational offset of real and diffraction space due to rotation of the beam in the projector system.  Without this step, the coordinate system of the strain measurements are not known, and the resulting strain maps are not interpretable in real space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- elliptical distortions: any minor tilt of the optic axis with respect to the detector distorts circles into ellipses in the resulting diffraction patterns; in a well-aligned tool, this causes elliptical distortions of 2-3% or greater.  Obtaining the most accurate strain maps requires measuring and correcting these distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q pixel calibations: careful measurement of the detector pixel size is necessary to obtain lattice measurements from diffraction data on an absolute scale.  Crystalline peaks of known spacing from a calibration sample are important, as in real samples (especially containing strain) the absolute local lattice spacings are often uncertain.  Without this step, only relative strain (e.g. compression/tension relative to some locally measured region) can be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the analysis described here works for single crystalline samples.  For polycrystalline or amorphous samples, additional processing is necessary.  On-axis data is required, such that Bragg disks in two, non-colinear directions are captured.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of microscope parameters is crucial, and optimal parameters will vary from one system to the next.  Some considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- camera length: optimally, as many Bragg disks as possible are present.  Thus, if there is sufficient scattering / camera dynamic range to capture disks at high angles, a large camera angle may be useful.  This consideration should be balanced against ensuring that the beam spans sufficiently many pixels - a beam that is only a few pixels wide will limit the [precision with which disk positions can be measured](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05504).\n",
    "\n",
    "- convergence angle: disks that are too close can compromise disk detection; the convergence angle should be chosen such that the disks do not overlap, and optimally are separated by at least ~1 disk spacing.\n",

    "\n",
    "A 4D-STEM scan over vacuum, using *identical* microscope parameters to those used in obtaining the 4D-STEM scan.  This includes identical convergence angles, camera lengths, and binning.  This is used to generate a template of the vacuum probe, which is used to locate the Bragg disks.  While a single diffraction pattern over vacuum is in principle sufficient, a small 4D-STEM scan over vacuum - perhaps ~10x10 scan positions - is a very good idea, to obtain a higher SNR average probe.\n",

    "##### Calibration sample scan\n",
    "\n",
    "A 4D-STEM scan of a standard calibration sample.  This should be a sample with (1) precisely known lattice spacings, and (2) sufficiently many polycrystalline domains within the scanned region that Bragg reflections in all directions are represented.  This latter requirement is important for elliptical distortion measurements.  A small 4D-STEM scan - again, perhaps ~10x10 scan positions - is sufficient.\n",

    "Two images are included here: first is an image of the sample - a HAADF scan taken immediately before or after the 4D-STEM scan is often easiest, though any STEM image (bright field, LAADF, MAADF...) should suffice.  A virtual image from the 4D-STEM can also be used.  Second, a CBED pattern which has been defocused until a shadow image of the same region in the HAADF data is visible.  The rotation between these two images are then used to calibrate the rotational offset between the sample plane and the diffraction plane, which is essential to obtaining meaningful strain maps.\n",
