# Functions for background subtraction.
#
# These functions generally accept DataCube objects as arguments, and return a new, modified
# DataCube.
# Most of these functions are also included as DataCube class methods.  Thus
#       datacube = preprocess_function(datacube, *args)
# will be identical to
#       datacube.preprocess_function(*args)
