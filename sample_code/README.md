# py4DSTEM sample code and tutorials

This directory contain sample code intended to provide an introduction to the py4DSTEM package and various examples of its use.

The sample code here is under development.  The notebooks currently working with py4DSTEM v12.0+ are:
- `quickstart.ipynb`
- `visualize/show.ipynb`
- `visualize/show_image_grids.ipynb`
- `visualize/show_calibrated_data.ipynb`
- `strainmap_crystalline/calibrate.ipynb`
- `strainmap_crystalline/strainmap.ipynb`

If you're new to the package, try beginning with `quickstart.ipynb`.



## Sample data

Sample datasets are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GmxF1ltY7hBU4d5ZK8INXjaRW5Etnw_4).
Links to individual datasets are provided in the sample code files which make use of them.
Once you've selected a file of sample code to run, find the link in that file to the dataset it uses, download and place it somewhere in your filesystem, then edit the filepath in the code to indicate where you've put that data.



## Get and run the code


To run the sample files in this directory, you can download this repository from github by clicking on the green 'Code' button, unzip the files, and place them somewhere on your system.
Then navigate to the `sample_code` directory on your local filesystem, choose a sample `.ipynb` or `.py` file, and try running it.


The anaconda navigator can be used to launch various python interfaces, including Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, PyCharm, and others.
From any python environment with py4DSTEM installed, you can import py4DSTEM to access all its modules and functions using `import py4DSTEM`.
